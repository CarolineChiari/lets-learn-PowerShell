## Introduction

THe goal of this repository is to give you examples and lessons for learning PowerShell.

## Warning

Even though this is common sense, I need to put it in there:

**Do not run any code from the internet that you do not understand!**
***Always* read the code before running it.**

## Prerequisites and useful resources

[PowerShell official documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/)

## The basics

### ✅ Cmdlets

Cmdlets (pronounces 'command lets') are commands in PowerShell used to run actions.

[Lesson](Cmdlets/cmdlets.md)
[Code](Cmdlets/cmdlets.ps1)

### ✅ Variables

Variables are a way to store information so that it can be used later.

[Lesson](Variables/variables.md)

### ✅ Arrays

Arrays are a collection of values, it allows you to store multiple values in one object. Think of it as a list for your groceries, the piece of paper is the array and each item is a element of the array.

[Lesson](Arrays/arrays.md)

### ✅ Hashtables

Hashtables are a data structure that allows you to store data similar to an array except it is stored in key/value pairs.

[Lesson](Hashtables/hashtables.md)

### Loops

### Conditionals

### Functions

### (Optional) Aliases

Aliases are a shortened way to invoke cmdlets and other PowerShell entities. **They are not considered best practice and should be avoided as much as possible**. They are only in this lesson plan because some people do use them and it can be useful for you to know them. There will be no lesson about them, but feel free to read the documentation about them:
